            <h2><strong>We provide global security solutions specializing in anti terrorisim, anti piracy and perimeter security to protect lives and property:</strong></h2>
                <p>Knowledgeable and experienced personnel should assist the captain and vessel owners to inspect the entry and boarding points that are attractive to
                     pirates and vulnerable to ocean boarding. The security consultants would advise the captain on what methods to take, once at sea, to secure these vulnerable areas. 
                     Those areas that cannot be immediately secured upon sailing must be pinpointed for later lock down should the pirates succeed in breaching the initial layers of security. 
                    Security consultants will also analyze escape routes and secure holding areas that can be used as areas of safe retreat should the outer perimeter be breached.</p>

            <h1><strong>Training</strong></h1>
                <p>Ship personnel will undergo specialized training in the actions that need to be taken in the event of an attack. 
                    De-sensitivity training, to ensure a calm response, as opposed to a panic reaction, will be a necessary component of 
                    the training program. Personnel will not be trained to engage the pirates, but rather in techniques to safely retreat 
                    and secure the vessel to hinder the takeover by pirates. Specialized equipment and highly trained protection dogs will be 
                    provided as part of the multi-layered security. 
                    Ship personnel will be trained in the use and care of that equipment and the handling of the dogs.</p>
            <h2><strong>Special Forces Personnel</strong></h2>
                    <p>Highly specialized, trained personnel, who have extensive military, marine and combat security experience, 
                        may also be provided as needed to remain on board during transit. It will be the responsibility of these operatives to ensure that all the 
                        security initiatives have been implemented and to provide 24-hour surveillance and patrols. They will be responsible for monitoring the specialized equipment, 
                        handling the dogs, and organizing and initiating the response to any threat. Their primary objective will be to change the profile of the vessel from being a “soft target”
                         to one that will require extreme effort and risk to board. 
                        With the element of surprise lost and the possibility of strong resistance, it is likely that the pirates will withdraw seeking easier prey elsewhere.</p>
            <h3><strong>Sophisticated Technology</strong></h3>
            <p>As firearms are not an option on most merchant vessels, it will be necessary to employ sophisticated technology to detect and repel the pirates. 
                Long Range Acoustic Devices, Magnetic Audio Devices, Thermal Imagers, Night Sun Torches and Anti Boarding Systems are only part of the vast array of technological devices 
                that will be used to discourage boarding. 
                The security needs of each vessel will be individually analyzed and assessed, and the correct blend of devices will be employed to provide the maximum security.</p>
